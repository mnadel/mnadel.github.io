The Agile Backlog:<br/>
Where ideas go to die,<br/>
Even the good ones.

Demotivating,<br/>
All that stuff you will not do.<br/>
Letâ€™s stop pretending.

Grooming is futile.<br/>
Rarely will you find a gem<br/>
In your list of stuff.

But that idea,<br/>
The one that is amazing.<br/>
It will resurface.

Do not move the card,<br/>
It has a carrying cost.<br/>
It will be okay.

You have permission<br/>
To remain motivated.<br/>
Delete it instead.
